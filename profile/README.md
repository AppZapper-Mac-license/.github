## Overview

<a href="https://placeholder.link">AppZapper for macOS</a> is a focused application removal and cleanup built around drag-and-drop uninstallation with related file detection. The layout keeps primary actions close at hand, while inspectors and sidebars reveal deeper options only when they are needed. That separation helps keep complex sessions readable without hiding important controls.

In everyday use, AppZapper encourages a rhythm where you move quickly between overview screens and detailed views. Keyboard shortcuts, menus and drag-and-drop gestures follow familiar <a href="https://placeholder.link">macOS conventions</a>, so you can lean on muscle memory instead of constantly hunting through menus or palettes.

Under the hood, the app coordinates multiple <a href="https://placeholder.link">specialized components</a> tuned for application removal and cleanup work. Rendering, data handling and background tasks are structured to keep interaction responsive even when projects grow. For users who rely on the tool every day, that kind of stability is just as important as raw features.

For power users, AppZapper exposes presets, templates and reusable profiles that capture common application removal and cleanup patterns. You can encode preferred configurations for views, devices, scenes or sessions, then reuse them across new work. This reduces repetitive setup and makes behavior more predictable across machines and collaborators.

Over time, <a href="https://placeholder.link">AppZapper</a> is updated with refinements that respect existing workflows. Rather than constantly redesigning the interface, the focus is on compatibility, performance and subtle quality-of-life improvements. That steady evolution helps the app feel like a long-term part of a macOS toolkit, not a moving target.
